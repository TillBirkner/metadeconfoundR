Description: Using non-parametric tests, naive associations between omics 
    features and metadata in cross-sectional data-sets are detected. In a second 
    step, confounding effects between metadata associated to the same omics 
    feature are detected and labeled using nested post-hoc model comparison
    tests, as first described in 
    Forslund, Chakaroun, Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, et al. (2021) <doi:10.1038/s41586-021-04177-9>. 
    The generated output can be graphically summarized using the built-in plotting function.
