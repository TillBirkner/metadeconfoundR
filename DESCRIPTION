Title: Check Multiple Covariates for Potenial Confounding Effects
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Sofia Forslund, Till Birkner
Maintainer: Till Birkner <metadeconf@till-birkner.de>
Description: Using non-parametric tests, naive associations between omics 
    features and metadata in cross-sectional data-sets are detected. In a second 
    step, confounding effects between metadata associated to the same omics 
    feature are detected and labeled using nested post-hoc model comparison 
    tests. The generated output can be graphically summarized using the 
    built-in plotting function.
